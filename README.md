# Car-Rental-Management-System
This is a Car Rental Web Page 
The Car Rental Management System is a simple Java and Python based desktop application designed to streamline the process of renting vehicles. It allows users to book cars, return them, view availability, and manage customer details. The system uses a MySQL database to securely store all rental and customer information, making the rental process faster, more accurate, and less prone to errors. The main motivation behind this project is to replace manual record-keeping in car rental services with an automated solution that saves time and improves efficiency.

The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly system that can handle essential car rental operations smoothly and securely. It aims to reduce paperwork, minimize booking errors, and ensure that all rental records are safely stored in a centralized database for easy access and future reference.

Traditional car rental services often rely on manual processes, which can lead to double bookings, misplaced records, and delays in service. This project addresses those issues by offering a digital platform where all bookings, returns, and customer data are managed automatically through a connected SQL database.

The scope of this project includes core features such as adding new vehicles, booking and returning cars, and viewing rental history. It also includes an admin panel for managing users and vehicle inventory. However, the system is limited to desktop use and does not currently support online reservations or payment integration. It is primarily intended for educational use and small-scale rental businesses.
requirements by showcasing technical documentation, UML modeling, and a structured report aligned with institutional rubrics.


# Review of Existing Car Rental Systems

Several car rental systems currently exist in the market, each aiming to simplify vehicle booking and management. Popular systems such as Zoomcar, Ola Drive, and Hertz Car Rental provide online platforms for users to rent vehicles based on time or distance. These platforms typically allow users to register, verify identity, choose a car, make payments, and track rentals through mobile or web applications.
However, most existing systems are highly dependent on internet connectivity and complex backend frameworks. Smaller agencies often lack affordable, customized solutions to manage car availability, billing, and customer records. Manual record-keeping or spreadsheet-based systems still dominate small and medium rental businesses, leading to errors, data loss, and inefficiency.
The proposed Java-based Car Rental System aims to address these issues by offering a lightweight, offline-capable application that provides efficient management of cars, customers, and transactions while ensuring data integrity and ease of use.
